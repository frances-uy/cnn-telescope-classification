# Atmospheric Cloud Classification for Gemini North Telescope

A machine learning system that automatically classifies cloud formations to assist telescope operators in making weather-related operational decisions at the Gemini North Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaii.

## üî≠ Project Overview

The Gemini North Telescope, located at 14,000 feet on Maunakea's summit, requires precise weather monitoring to protect its equipment and optimize observation time. This project enhances operators' ability to identify cloud-induced weather risks by implementing a real-time CNN-based classification system.

**Key Achievement:** Developed a transfer-learned ResNet50 model achieving **85% accuracy** on cloud pattern classification, deployed as a real-time inference system integrated with existing cloud camera infrastructure.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Telescope operators at the Gemini Hilo Base Facility currently rely solely on manual interpretation of still images from cloud cameras to assess weather threats. This project automates cloud classification to provide operators with:
- Real-time cloud category predictions every 20 seconds
- Enhanced weather risk assessment capabilities
- Reduced telescope downtime from unexpected cloud cover

## üß† Technical Approach

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** Pre-trained ResNet50 (transfer learning)
- **Classification Categories:** 4 cloud types
  - Clear skies
  - Cirrus clouds  
  - Cumulus clouds
  - Fog/Virga
- **Training Strategy:** Gradual unfreezing with decreasing learning rates
- **Performance:** 85% test accuracy on real telescope camera data

### Dataset
- **Size:** 200+ manually labeled images from Gemini cloud cameras
- **Validation:** Cross-checked with telescope operators
- **Augmentation:** Rotation, shifts, flips, zoom, brightness variations
- **Split:** 80% training, 20% validation

### Deployment Architecture
- **Containerized Solution:** Docker deployment for scalability
- **Real-time Processing:** Processes images every 20 seconds
- **Web Interface:** Flask-based dashboard for operators
- **Infrastructure:** VM-based deployment with CPU optimization

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Classification:** Automated analysis of cloud camera images
- **Web Dashboard:** User-friendly interface displaying current conditions
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker-based system for easy deployment
